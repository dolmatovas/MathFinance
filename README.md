My notebooks on Mathematical finance

Ongoing projects:

1. [Asian options pricing in BS model](https://github.com/dolmatovas/MathFinance/blob/main/asian%20options/Asian%20option%20pricing.ipynb)
In this project I'm considering different approaches for asian option pricing, such as Monte carlo simulation, variance reduction techniques(moment matching, control variate), quasi-monte carlo methods, lognormal distribution approximation and conditioning on final spot price. I'm also going to cover different finite differences approaches and Laplace transformation technuqie.

2. [Heston model, fourier analysis and finite diferences](https://github.com/dolmatovas/MathFinance/blob/main/Notebooks/Heston%20FD/finite%20differences.ipynb)
In this project I wrote a code for pricing vanilla options in Heston Model, based on exact formula and numerical solution of corresponding Heston PDE. For solving PDE I used alternating direction scheme, which is numerically stable.
